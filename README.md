Question: 
  How does a chatbot searh bar affect customer experience for online shoppers?
  
Abstract:
  Existing literature has stated chatbots could be beneficial for online shopping over conventional search tools such as filters. Recent technologies are capable of semantic search to recognise context and intent rather than keywords. This could provide more relevant results and increase customer engagement while shopping online, potentially improving customer experience. However, this literature has neither focused on chatbots as a search bar; nor used practical research to prove their theories, possibly due to the lack of chatbot tools to conduct this research. Using emerging web technologies such as RiveScript, this study demonstrates a chatbot search bar integrated into a popular student online shopping site for practical research. This addresses the existing literature in an attempt to stabilise our knowledge of online shopping customer experience and explore a chatbotâ€™s impact. After conducting research with mixed student participants, using both the original and chatbot concept websites, analysis of the data and recordings through a comparative discussion. There are now constructive findings clearly supporting the literature.
